==============================
Getting Started with Python
==============================
Day 2 [1.M] (1/30)
------------------------------


What is Python?
------------------
 * A programming language
 * interpreted
    * each line is read by an interpreter
    * different than a compiled language like C


Python Interpreter
---------------------
 * <open iterpreter>
 * demonstrate using it as a calculator
 * do some simple equations
    * 1 + 3 + 6 / 2 = 7 (order of ops)
    * 20 / 0  (errors)
    * 3 / 2 = 1 (int math)
    * 3 / 2.0 = 1.5
    * most of these will be covered in depth later

Python Programs
-----------------------
`See Example 1 <./d1ex1.py>`_

 * open an empty file
 * ``#!/usr/bin/env python``
     * unix specific, just add it to the top of files
 * show ``print`` command with "hello world"
 * reopen interpreter and type in the same lines, it should work the same
 * adding comments with ``#``
    * Sign the top of the file
    * make some notes before a print
    * make some notes at the end of a line
 

Commiting files with Git and Github
---------------------------------------------
 * everyone should be all setup with git and github at this point on their machine
 * just do homework 1 in class to help people with turning it in, the biggest issue
 * anyone who isn't already setup the TA's will help
