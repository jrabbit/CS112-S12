# Grouping Data
* Variables and numbers and what not are fun, but sometimes it makes sense to group things together

## Lists and Tuples (and strings!)
* creating with [], (3), and "asb"
* all of them are sequences

## Indexing

## Dictionaries


## Example
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""
simon.py

play simon against the computer
"""
```

## Advanced Topics
* slicing
* nested (eventually everyone will get to it)
* list comprehensions
