# Numbers
##Integers
* integers.  positive/negative whole numbers
    * 2, -3, 0
* longs:  really really big integers.  
    * 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000L
* python should convert between these two types automatically if your integers get too big
* Longs end in a "L", don't worry about it if you see one, it just means big number

##Floats
* A number with a decimal
    * 3.5, -0.23
* called floats because of floating decimal points
    * _coders_ actually a double
* can also be written in scientific notation
    * -5.23E-4

> there are more that are not covered like complex numbers, it shouldn't come up

> cover integer division here and make them do a basic math problem in the interpreter

# Booleans
* True or False
* Almost everything evaluates to True _except_: an empty list `[]`, an empty string `""`, and `0`
