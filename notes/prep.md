# Getting the course ready
 * Setting up the lab
     * ~~install git to stout~~
     * install ipython to ~~stout and~~ just ASH
 * Test out Cygwin
     * ~~reinstall on windows~~
     * ~~check python versions~~ python 2.6
     * ~~check vim (for self)~~ gvim not great and vim buggy, more reason to use emacs
     * ~~check emacs for windows~~ no go, meta keys are screwy, cygwin + xemacs seems best, _learn it_
 * Software
     * emacs will probably work, (I will add my own vim bindings -a)
     * figure out what emacs plugins make developing python easier, especially tabs and spaces (tabs should be banned)
     * ipython works on all platforms, making sure people install setup tools would be nice as well (pip would be better but hard in cygwin -a)
 * Mac
     * install still woefully out of date, no real access to a computer
     * a virtualbox install for that would also work
     * probably should get one up and running for now and have people use that.  Or a usb liveCD.
     * 
 * Create Virtualbox snapshot
     * small harddrive, simple linux install
     * teach about virtual box, MAKE SURE ALL SOFTWARE IS INSTALLED
     * which python to use could screw with things...
     * possibly a more minimal distro, really really (debian based so I know my way around)
     * configure emacs well
     * use simple webpages for user setup (python based cgi should work, and work wonders)
     * give sudo access, disable password
     * make sure disk has a "recovery" option...
     * they should probably be editing their project file in the share
