# Course Lecture Notes

Eventually these notes should be migrated to the course wiki and kept updated there.  Alternatively, they should just be "hidden" until after a course happens.  Each lecture could have the notes available ahead of time in addition to any readings.

## Topics (in relative order)
These should just be printed as one giant file when complete.




## Advanced (should be covered)
I would like to teach an "advanced section" (optional) as a sort of informal coder meeting about what we are doing in class.  This would not necessarily be for homework help, simply for people looking to do something a little bit more.
 * functional programming in python
 * metaclasses
 * design patterns
 * opengl

## Misc Thoughts
 * game design should probably never be covered really
 * Homework assignments should not only reflect what was covered but also good programming practice
 * demonstrate whitespace and typo errors early.  They are the most common and they need to be debugged first.
 * have some homework assignments on debugging.  Or at least a quick and easy "bonus points" debugging assignments
 * Issue tracking
    * too much to ask?
    * could issue tracking be a good way to do "bonus points"?
