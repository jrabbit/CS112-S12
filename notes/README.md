# Course Lecture Notes
Eventually these notes should be migrated to the course wiki and kept updated there.  Alternatively, they should just be "hidden" until after a course happens.  Each lecture could have the notes available ahead of time in addition to any readings.

## Topics (in relative order)
These should just be printed as one giant file when complete.

 * Day One
 * Setting Up Your Environment
 * Getting Started
 * [Datatypes](https://github.com/zego5360/CS112-S12/blob/master/notes/datatypes.md)
     * [Numbers/Booleans](https://github.com/zego5360/CS112-S12/blob/master/notes/numbers.md)
     * [Strings](https://github.com/zego5360/CS112-S12/blob/master/notes/strings.md)
 * [Variables](https://github.com/zego5360/CS112-S12/blob/master/notes/vars.md)
 * Operators (to copy)
 * Conditionals
     * while
     * if
     * break, continue, pass
 * lists, tuples
 * for loops
 * [Functions](https://github.com/zego5360/CS112-S12/blob/master/notes/funcs.md)
 * dictionaries
 * file input/parsing
 * nested for loops
 * objects
 * inheritence
 * creating modules
 

## Advanced (should be covered)
I would like to teach an "advanced section" (optional) as a sort of informal coder meeting about what we are doing in class.  This would not necessarily be for homework help, simply for people looking to do something a little bit more.

 * functional programming in python
 * metaclasses
 * design patterns
 * opengl
 * state machines
 * menus

## Misc Thoughts
 * game design should probably never be covered really
 * demonstrate whitespace and typo errors early.  They are the most common and they need to be debugged first.
 * have some homework assignments on debugging.  Or at least a quick and easy "bonus points" debugging assignments
 * should pickle be taught at some point to save game objects/state?
